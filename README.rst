About SocialButterfly
=====================

This is a work in progress. My goal is to have a desktop app that allows one
to post to as many common social networks as possible. Both text and image
posts will be supported.

Initially I plan to support Mastodon, Twitter, and Bluesky. Others may come
later. Plans to support Facebook and other Meta platforms are currently on
hold because their API is broken by design and their process for getting an
application approved for meaningful API access is needlessly onerous.

My motive for writing this is that while there are existing services that
allow one to do this (e.g. Hootsuite, Buffer), these typically cost an arm
and a leg (like, $100 *per month*), plus they contain all sorts of
supposedly “value-added” extra features that I just don’t need. (If there
was a way to delete those features and get a basic service for around
$100/year, I’d probably spring for it.)
